    <p>ID: </p>
    <p id="id_selection">Caller</p>
    <p>
        The "Caller" connects to "Answerer". So if this site has connected to server with "Caller" 
        ID and there's "Answerer" ID connected to the server too, press "Connect to peer". Answerer 
        doesn't need to do anything. When the connection is established, let the chatting begin!
        <br />
        <br />
        PS. There's no notification of any sort of the connection being established yet. This is just 
        a demo of the PeerJS after all. You can see the get requests in console though. If there's no 
        errors in the console, it should be working.
